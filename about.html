        <h2>Joshua Larson</h2>
        <p>I was originally a pre-med student that found a lot more satisfaction from writing code than disecting specimen.  When I realized I liked learning how to automate tasks more than biology, I started learning python.  My first project was an application that could cut an hour long work task into a 5 minute task.  After my first project I decided to join Lambda School to learn web development in order to find a job and get a BS in Computer Science.</p>
